The main functions are \code{connect}, which establishes a connection,
\code{query}, which issues queries and \code{fetch}, which retieves results.
Intelligent defaults are used throughout. Functions that require a connection
will automatically attempt to establish a valid connection based on a previous
connection or from defaults. The defaults can be overriden in a variety of
ways.
